<li> Use a barcode reader to scan your books in - it finds
  author,title, publisher and sometimes cover art automatically 
</li>
<li> Assign them to shelves ("downstairs/living room/behind tv/1") 
  so you can find them again
<li> Sort them into collections ("public", "private", "reference")
  so you control who gets to see what
<li> Lend them to friends by clicking on a button and picking
  from a list 
<li> Browse your friends' books and see what you would like to borrow.
<span class=small>This requires that your friends are using
  booksh.lv, of course.  Invite them!</span>
