"libros non legendos sed lectitandos", Plin. Ep. 2, 17, 8:
        Books must not be read but read eagerly.

Whether it's a a well-stocked library with shelves stacked floor to
ceiling, or a pile of well-thumbed paperpacks on the bedroom
windowsill, a real book collection is more than a carbon-laminate
serialisation of bits that could be more compactly kept on a Kindle.
A book collection is a social experience: you can browse, lend, borrow
and discuss books with your friends, and they can feed you coffee and
cake while you do it.  Some or all of this might be possible with
ereaders, but somehow it's not the same.
